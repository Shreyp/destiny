			I see. There are a number of pharmaceuticals I could inject to simulate the desired emotional state. There is a high statistical probability of death by gunshot. A punch to the face is also likely. My smouldering good looks? If I die in here, I’ll kill him. We appreciate your patience. Please continue to hold.
			<br />
			Shepard. Loudspeakers? Someone likes the sound of their voice. The Collectors killed you once, and all it did was piss you off. I can't imagine they'll stop you this time. Huh. Nobody died. It’s always a good idea to RTFM, ma’am.
			<br />
			Many think less of quarians for traveling in the flotilla, and for creating the geth. They see us as scavengers, little better than thieves. It’s so easy to see the galaxy in black and white. Gray? I don’t know what to do with gray. I got better, Shepard. I got you. Alloy of EDI’s body not like organic tissue. Could cause unintentional damage. Recommend pillows, cushions, possibly gel packs. It’ll either be a night to treasure, or a horrible interspecies awkwardness thing.
			<br />
			Why is it that whenever someone says 'with all due respect', they really mean 'kiss my ass?' Does this unit have a soul? How comforting, to be at peace with the instinct to kill. The krogan are creatures of such pure, almost innocent, reflex Hell, Garrus, you were always ugly. Slap some face-paint on there, and no one will even notice. On the flotilla, we don’t have the luxury of sexism. We need the best hands for every available job.
			<br />
			Ah, puberty ritual. Common among species with hormone-driven reproductive urges. Trying to take down a rogue Spectre and his army of synthetics? No, they didn’t cover this in Basic. Good. Get that out of the way so we can concentrate on being big g*****n heroes. Activate the neutron purge. Mordin. He got his tissue sample from me all right… Let’s just say scalpels were never meant to cut where he cut.
			<br />
			I believe they are amphibian. But there was one thing I was unable to verify. Did you really kill three Blue Suns mercs with one bullet? I’m Garrus Vakarian and this is now my favorite spot on the Citadel! I’ll relinquish one bullet. Where do you want it? This place is run down… even for a prison
			<br />
			Together we can stop Sovereign. We don’t have to submit to the Reapers. We can beat them! That argument is logical for an individual mind. We are not fully individuals. There are pieces of us in the heretics. One of those may be at fault. The matriarch hired by the asari government to track my movements? Call me princess again and you’ll be picking your teeth up off the floor. Your superiors are sending you to certain death for no good reason. You have a right to disobey.
			<br />
			No matter what happens here… you know I love you, I always will. Conrad, you have no idea what it takes to get the job done. This is how a gun in your face feels! It happens to me every day. You can’t handle this. I could throw a few salarians off a cliff if it’ll make you feel better. It’s necessary, Chief Williams. Even if it comes to a full-scale war, someone has to provide food to eat and a home to return to. They said it couldn't be done! Then again, that's been said about a lot of things you do.
			<br />
			Humans don't have that. You haven't seen Shepard in action. Trust me. It was money well spent. Really, Commander? When you put it that way, there’s no reason they wouldn’t like you. I mean, us! Humans! Ma’am. Clan Urdnot has increased in strength after the destruction of Clan Weyrlock. In addition killing the thresher maw has produced several breeding requests for Grunt, and one for Shepard.
			<br />
			There was a hole. Trapped inside a Reaper. Could be worse. Don’t know how, but… I guess it could be full of rats. Call me princess again and you’ll be picking your teeth up off the floor. I could throw a few salarians off a cliff if it’ll make you feel better. You’re breaking the law for bribe money. You know what we do to dirty cops on my world?
